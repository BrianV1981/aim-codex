# A.I.M. Technical Handbook (Master Schema)

This document is the definitive architectural map for the A.I.M. platform. It defines the modular components of the brain and the protocols that ensure continuity and sovereignty.

---

## SECTION 1: THE ROOT ARCHITECTURE

### 1.1 `GEMINI.md` (The Soul)
- **Role:** Lean Orchestrator.
- **Function:** A pointer-native source of truth. It directs the agent to query the **Engram DB** for technical policies rather than carrying them in the context window.

### 1.2 `setup.sh` (The Bootstrapper)
- **Function:** Automates venv creation and performs the **Nuclear Alias Reset** to ensure the `aim` command is always correctly linked to the local project.

---

## SECTION 2: THE ENGRAM DB (SUBCONSCIOUS)
The core of A.I.M.'s memory lives in a local SQLite database (`archive/engram.db`).

### 2.1 The Pre-Born Brain
During initialization, A.I.M. indexes this Handbook and core project directives. This provides the agent with "Day Zero" technical knowledge.

### 2.2 Synapse Ingestion
The `synapse/` folder is a dedicated intake zone. Any technical references dropped here are recursively indexed as `expert_knowledge`.

### 2.3 The Synapse Exchange (`aim exchange`)
Expertise is portable. A.I.M. can `export` its indexed knowledge into compressed `.aim` packs, allowing you to share a pre-trained "Python Expert" or "Solana Architect" brain with other machines without re-indexing.

---

## SECTION 3: THE SCHOLASTIC HIERARCHY (CONSCIOUSNESS)
Memory is refined through a tiered chain of command to prevent knowledge decay and bloat.

### 3.1 Tier 1: The Librarian (`session_summarizer.py`)
- **Frequency:** Hourly / Session End.
- **Function:** Uses the **Signal Filter** to strip tool noise and writes a surgical technical narrative of the recent turns into the daily logs.

### 3.2 Tier 2: The Chancellor (`src/chancellor.py`)
- **Frequency:** Daily.
- **Function:** Synthesizes multiple session narratives into a **Daily Milestone Report**.

### 3.3 Tier 3: The Fellow (`src/fellow.py`)
- **Frequency:** Weekly.
- **Function:** Conducts a strategic review of the week's accomplishments and proposes the next week's trajectory.

### 3.4 Tier 4: The Dean (`src/dean.py`)
- **Frequency:** Monthly.
- **Function:** The final filter. Refines the **Project Soul** (`MEMORY.md`) by identifying the only facts worth keeping for the long term.

---

## SECTION 4: SAFETY & SOVEREIGNTY

### 4.1 The Safety Sentinel (`hooks/safety_sentinel.py`)
- **Hardened Protection:** Intercepts destructive commands and performs a Level 2 AI intent audit. Uses `EXIT 2` to force blocks even in YOLO mode.

### 4.2 The Obsidian Bridge (`scripts/obsidian_sync.py`)
- **Role:** Sovereign Mirror.
- **Function:** Mirroring of Daily Logs, Core Memory, and **Raw JSON Transcripts** to an external vault for 100% recovery.

---

## SECTION 5: SYSTEM MAINTENANCE & UPDATES

### 5.1 The Sovereign Update (`aim update`)
- **Role:** High-Fidelity Sync.
- **Function:** Automates the lifecycle of keeping A.I.M. current.
- **Protocol:**
  1. **Source Sync:** Performs a `git pull origin main` to fetch the latest TUI, scripts, and engine logic.
  2. **Hook Refresh:** Re-registers all system hooks to ensure the local Gemini CLI is utilizing the latest architectural guardrails.
  3. **Data Preservation (Safe Update):** The update logic explicitly protects your **Personality Trinity** (`GEMINI.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`). These files are never overwritten, ensuring the bot's soul remains intact across versions.

---

## SECTION 6: THE HYBRID SOUL PROTOCOL

A.I.M. maintains technical continuity through a dual-mode ingestion engine within `src/bootstrap_brain.py`. This ensures that active instructions stay current while expert knowledge remains permanent.

### 6.1 Foundation Sync (Active Instructions)
- **Scope:** `GEMINI.md`, `core/MEMORY.md`, and all files in `docs/`.
- **Logic:** These files are **Synchronized**. 
- **Behavior:** If a foundation file is modified on disk, its previous engram in the DB is overwritten by the new version. This ensures A.I.M. always follows the absolute current project mandates.

### 6.2 Synapse Ingestion (Permanent Knowledge)
- **Scope:** Everything dropped into the `synapse/` folder.
- **Logic:** This is an **Onramp**.
- **Behavior:** Once a file is indexed from Synapse, it is **Permanently Persistent** in the Engram DB. The source files on disk can be safely deleted to keep the workspace lean; A.I.M. will still retain and retrieve the knowledge from the database.

### 6.3 Amnesia Protection
- **0-Byte Shield:** The bootstrap engine automatically skips empty or 0-byte files. This prevents accidental "Technical Amnesia" where an empty file on disk could overwrite and hollow out a valid engram in the database.

---

## SECTION 7: UNIVERSAL SOVEREIGNTY (MCP & SYNC)

A.I.M. is designed to integrate seamlessly with your wider engineering ecosystem while maintaining absolute data sovereignty.

### 7.1 The Universal Hub (Cockpit)
- **Role:** Centralized configuration for all reasoning models.
- **Function:** The `aim tui` supports OAuth (Google CLI, Codex CLI), API Keys, OpenRouter, and local Ollama routing. It includes **Cognitive Health Checks** to verify provider integrity in real-time.

### 7.2 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server
- **Role:** IDE Integration.
- **Function:** A built-in `fastmcp` server (`src/mcp_server.py`) exposes the A.I.M. Engram DB as a standard tool. This allows IDEs like Cursor and VS Code, or agents like Claude Desktop, to natively query your project's historical continuity and mandates.

### 7.3 Sovereign Sync (Git Synchronization)
- **Role:** Binary Conflict Resolution.
- **Function:** SQLite databases (`engram.db`) cause binary merge conflicts in Git. A.I.M. circumvents this by translating the database into deterministic `.jsonl` files (`archive/sync/`) during `aim push` and `aim sync`. When you run `aim update` on another machine, it surgically ingests those `.jsonl` files back into the local database, allowing seamless multi-device brain synchronization.

### 7.4 The "Index-First" Retrieval Protocol
- **Role:** Token-Efficient Discovery.
- **Command:** `aim map`
- **Function:** Instead of performing a blind, high-token search, A.I.M. can first pull a surgical "Knowledge Map" (a list of all indexed documents and session IDs). This allows the agent to see *what* is known before deciding *where* to search, scaling the architecture to massive ecosystem-level projects without hitting context limits.

---

## SECTION 8: DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE (THE PHASE PROTOCOL)

A.I.M. development is highly structured to prevent regressions and provide clear rollback points for AI agents.

### 8.1 The Branching Strategy
1.  **Ideation & Planning:** The roadmap is updated on `main` to explicitly define the next phase (e.g., Phase 21).
2.  **Execution Branch:** A new branch is cut (e.g., `dev-phase-21`). All TDD and feature work occurs here.
3.  **The Archive Cut:** Before merging the completed `dev-` branch, the *current* state of `main` is cloned to a timestamped archive branch (e.g., `phase-20-20260321-2328`). This freezes the previous phase in an immutable, known-good state.
4.  **The Merge:** The `dev-` branch is merged into `main`, establishing the new baseline.

### 8.2 Why this Protocol?
While creating branches instead of Git Tags for archiving might seem non-standard in human-only teams, it is highly optimized for AI-driven development. It provides the agent with explicit, readable branches that act as immediate "Save States" if a phase goes completely off the rails, ensuring catastrophic architectural mistakes can be reverted instantly without complex `git reflog` operations.

---

## SECTION 9: TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD) POLICY

### 9.1 The Mandate
Every functional change, bug fix, or new feature **MUST** be governed by the TDD lifecycle. No code enters the `src/` directory without a corresponding verification script. Verification is not just "running code"; it is the empirical proof of correctness.

### 9.2 The Lifecycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
1.  **RED (Reproduction):** Create a reproduction script or unit test that fails. This defines the "Current Broken State."
2.  **GREEN (Fix):** Apply the minimal surgical code change required to make the test pass.
3.  **REFACTOR (Polish):** Clean up the implementation for idiomatic quality and performance while ensuring the test remains green.

### 9.3 Verification Standards
- **Unit Tests:** Preferred for utility functions and logic-heavy modules (using `pytest` or `unittest`).
- **Reproduction Scripts:** Mandatory for bug fixes. Prove the bug exists, then prove it's gone.
- **Protocol Isolation:** For MCP and cross-tool features, use mock clients to verify interface compliance without environmental bloat.
- **Zero-Token Validation:** Tests must be fast and autonomous. Avoid external API calls during testing unless the API itself is the target.
